# Final Test - Course: React II | Academia Desafio Latam.

## About the project
It's the final challenge to prove the student's learning outcome of the entire React course (Context API, Router Dom) through a coding exercise.

### Objectives
- Practice the use of Context API with an e-commerce paradigm and cart store logic.
- Review the use of useParams, useNavigate and Link in React applications.
- Review the use of the hooks useEffect, useState and Context.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- npm
```
npm install npm@latest -g
```
### Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:Rydozz15/challenge-react2-final.git
```
2. Install NPM packages
```
npm install
```
3. Run the App. Done!
```
npm run dev
```

## Usage
It's a mock e-commerce. The main use is to surf through the pages and add items and review them in the cart section.
That's it!

## Future improvements
1. Implement Typescript into the project.
2. Implement Tailwind CSS to practice a job-standard tool, and maybe enhance the UI.
